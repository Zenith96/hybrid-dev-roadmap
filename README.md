# Hybrid Developer Roadmap

This repository tracks my personal learning journey toward becoming a well-rounded backend developer with additional skills in data, cloud, and automation.

## Structure

The learning roadmap is divided into weekly modules. Each module contains curated resources, practice files, and progress checkpoints.

### Phase Breakdown

- **Phase 1**: Backend Foundation  
  Python, SQL, Git, basic data handling using Pandas and NumPy

- **Phase 2**: API & Cloud  
  FastAPI, Docker, JWT, async programming, CI/CD pipelines

- **Phase 3**: Advanced Backend Engineering  
  Cloud infrastructure, DevOps, monitoring, scalable systems

- **Phase 4**: Automation & Lightweight MLOps  
  Task scheduling, scripting, API integrations, basic ML pipelines

## Weekly Progress

Each `week-*` folder includes:
- Files and scripts written that week
- Commits to track daily effort

## Purpose

This roadmap serves both as a learning tracker and a portfolio of consistent development work. It is structured for clarity and sustainability, not speed. Everything here is done manually with the intent to deeply understand the tools and concepts involved.

## Note

All work here is original unless explicitly stated. Projects built by following tutorials are organized separately and will be refactored independently once understood.
